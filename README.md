### Hello!
My name is Nathan Logston. I am currently working on an Aerospace Engineering Degree at Iowa State University. 

A lot of my projects involve microcontrollers to do any number of random things that I'm working on, from raspberry pi's to esp8266 breakouts! I run several different servers for these projects as well, including my storage server I keep active 24/7. 

I'm currently using GitHub to complete my AerE 361 class, in which I will be learning about many computational techniques to solve aerospace problems. I hope to continue using github to develop my code, as it's a really easy way to keep all my code up to date across the many devices I use. 

If you want to contact me reguarding any of my work, please email me at natestorms416@gmail, or shoot me a message on discord @Natey416#6162
