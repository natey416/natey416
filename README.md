### Hello!
My name is Nathan Logston. I am a recent graduate, achieving my Bachelors in Aerospace Engineering from Iowa State!

A lot of my projects involve microcontrollers to do any number of random things that I'm working on, from raspberry pi's to esp8266 breakouts! I run several different servers for these projects as well, including my storage server I keep active 24/7. 

Recently, I've worked as a Systems Team Leader for a student led project called MAVRIC. You can find more about us [here](https://m2i.aere.iastate.edu/mavric/)! We have recently competed at the University Robotics Challenge, held in Utah from May 29th to June 2nd 2024. More information about URC can be found [here](https://urc.marssociety.org). While competing with 38 other robotics teams from around the world, we achieved 11th place, an all time high for MAVRIC and Iowa State!

If you want to contact me reguarding any of my work, please email me at natestorms416@gmail.com, or shoot me a message on discord @Natey416#6162
